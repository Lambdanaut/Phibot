======

Description
-----------

**wetbot.py** contains a class that abstracts away interacting with the Wetgenes chat. Import wetbot to write a bot of your very own. 

**Example.py** is Phibot, a documented example of a bot using the wetbot module. What you're probably going to want to do is edit this file. All of the more important variables like the bot's name and how it responds to commands are at the top of the code, while the rest of the code contains the functionality. 

Instructions
------------

If you're using Windows or a Mac you can get Phibot running using [Python 2.x.x](http://python.org/download/). It's very important that you download one of the 2.x.x versions, *not* the 3.x.x version! 

Once python is installed, double click on **Example.py** and run it. Make sure **Example.py** and **wetbot.py** are in the same directory or you're going to get some errors! 


If you're using Linux, just run 
 > git clone git@github.com:Lambdanaut/Phibot.git

 > cd Phibot

 > python2 Example.py

AND YOU'RE SET!

enjoy.
